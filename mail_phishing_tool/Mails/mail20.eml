Hi class,=C2=A0As I mentioned to some of you during the Security@KAIST Fair
today, I started feeling quite sick since last night. I was hoping that I
would get better during the day, but my condition is worsening. Hence, I am
afraid I will have to cancel tomorrow's class. However, I will provide a
make-up lecture soon.=C2=A0In the mean time, let's continue our lecture on
Monday, Dec. 2 (W14), where we will continue our discussion on the
Smartphone-based Counterfeit Detection. Also, Team 6 (Byungsoo) will
present his paper presentation on CapCam paper.=C2=A0I'm so sorry about thi=
s
sudden change. Thanks for your understanding.=C2=A0Jun
